![](qe-logo-large.png)

## Abstract

Several important new scientific computing environments have appeared in recent
years, generated by demand from and investment in artificial intelligence. This
workshop will provide a brief overview of these environments and their features,
including automatic differentiation, parallel computing, and just-in-time
compilers. We will discuss how these tools might be applied to economic
applications.  


## Details

* Location: International University of Japan
* Date: 2nd June 2025
* Time: 10:30 -- 12am
* Instructor: [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/)


## Additional Information

We will do some live coding and attendees who wish to follow along should bring
laptops.

If students wish to prepare for the seminar, they can install [Anaconda
Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and learn the basics of using Jupyter
and Python.  The first few [QuantEcon
lectures](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) might be helpful.
None of this is essential for the seminar.
